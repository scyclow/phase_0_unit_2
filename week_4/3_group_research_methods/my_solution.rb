# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# delete_if iterates through the source, deletes all objects that evaluate to true in the block, and spits out the new source.
# As with most enumerables, the block takes a key and value if called on a hash.
# reject accomplishes a similar goal, but is non-destructive (it returns a new array/hash, rather than the existing one), and returns nil if no changes were made.
# reject! is destructive, but also returns nil if no changes were made.
# Alternatively, find_all does the opposite of reject; it returns all objects that evaluate to true.

# Reflect!
# This was a good excuse to browse the ruby docs. I came across a couple interesting looking methods while looking for delete_if. 
# I couldn't find any methods that did 100% of the work, but delete_if does the mheavy lifting. I still had to fudge it a bit by passing it a block containing a method or two.
