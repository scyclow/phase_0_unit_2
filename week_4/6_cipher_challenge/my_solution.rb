# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with: Casey Ryan



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

            "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?

# Reflection

#This one was pretty fun. I liked the decyphered messages.
# Overall, there was some low-hanging fruit in this code, but there were a few refactors that took a bit more figuring out. For example, iterating through a list of letters and selecting a different letter based on its index is not particularly obvious. But, getting rid of the found_match boolean was a no brainer.
# Pairing on this one was fairly useful. I picked up a couple small tricks. It also helped with debugging. I'm slowly starting to realize that debugging is about 85% of coding, so having a couple pairs of eyes on the problem is always useful.
