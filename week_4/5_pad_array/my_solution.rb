# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# for the Array class, 
	# define a method called pad, accepting two paramaters: times and with. with is set to nil on default
		# create a variable called new array, equal to self
		# if times is negative or 0, return the array
		# 'times'.times, shove 'with' into the back of the array	
		# return new array
	# define a method called pad!, accepting two paramaters: times and with. with is set to nil on default
		# if times is negative or 0, return self
		# 'times'.times, shove 'with' into the back of self
		# return self
